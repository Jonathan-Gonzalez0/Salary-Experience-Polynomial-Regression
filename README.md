# Salary-Experience-Polynomial-Regression
This repository provides scripts and notebooks that analyze employee salaries in relation to years of experience. It uses data visualization (Seaborn, Matplotlib) and a polynomial regression model to illustrate and predict how experience levels influence salary trends, offering insights into compensation structures over time.


**Requirements:**
Python 3.12

**Note:** This project was developed using Spyder(6.0.1) from the Anaconda Navigator, which comes with many of these libraries pre-installed. If you're also using Spyder within Anaconda, you may already have most of these packages.

**Data:**
  **Important**: Place the CSV file in the same folder as the Python file (salary_analysis.py) so the script can locate it without additional configuration.
